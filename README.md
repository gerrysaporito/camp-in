# YelpCamp
<h3>A review website for all your favourite campgrounds</h3>

<p>Before I go to a new place for the first time, I always like to check the reviews to see how other's experiences went. The same thing should go for campsites; I don't want to go to a dangeorus campground with bear warnings or unswimmable lake water!</p>
<p>In response to my fears of picking a bad campsite for my annual family hiking vacations, I worked on making a review site for campgrounds.</p>
<p>Here, users can:
<ul>
  <li>login or sign up to view campgrounds other users submitted.</li>
  <li>post their own campsites</li>
  <li>comment on others campgrounds</li>
  <li>rate others campgrounds</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>With this web application out there, a person who loves camping and hiking never has to worry about choosing an adequate or avoiding dangerous locations ever again, and can see where the best places are during this season!</p>
<p>Because nobody wants to go on a family camping trips with the bears next door, right?</p>
